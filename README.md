## Coal Mine Safety Monitoring System

### Abstract
#### As coal mines are prone to a lot of fatalities. In order to reduce fatalities, it is better to keep the mine under constant monitoring which can send alerts when there is a change in parameters like temperature, fire and leakage of gases like methane which are likely a potential fatality. In order to avoid it we propose a monitoring system that can monitor basic safety measures and regulate such parameters. All the sensors can be assembled into a single unit and then placed in a coal mine for it to be monitored constantly.

### Introduction
#### Technology has been improving exponentially for past few years. Coal is the most abundant source of electricity worldwide, currently providing more than 36% of global electricity. As mining is one of the world’s most dangerous operation with thousands of workers dying each year as a result of massive explosions. According to a recent study around 12000 people have died due to such mining incidents. It is hard to get another source for electricity generation that can replace coal thus coal being one of the main sources for electricity, which basically is the main power source to the entire world in the current technological era where everything needs electricity to run.
Coal mining is the process of extracting coal from the ground. Steel and cement industries use coal as a fuel for extraction of iron from iron ore and for cement production. Underground mining industry comes to the category, where each and every parameter such as methane gas, high temperature, fire accidents and so on has to be monitored regularly. Safe production level of coal mine is still low, disasters in coal mine occur frequently, which lead to great loss of possession and life.
Coal mines are one of the most important industries in the country, as coal is used as a fuel in the steel and cement industries in order to extract iron from the stone and make cement. Although coal is one of the most essential resources there are a few problems in the mines, as workers have to risk their lives by working in coal mines and unfortunately some miners lose their life in coal mines.  In order to prevent such unnecessary deaths and fatalities it is essential to keep a constant track of variation in parameters like high temperature, fire and some gases like methane in underground mining. As the mining environment is a bit complicated due to the variety of activities performed in coal mines, thus it is important to monitor the working environment in order to avoid any fatality it is better to keep a monitoring system that can send an alert in case there is a chance for a fatality to occur. In order to make this work we propose a monitoring system that can monitor basic safety measures and regulate many  restrictions on coal mines, such as gas leaks, temperature, humidity control and fire sensor. All the sensors can be assembled into a single unit and then placed in a coal mine for it to be monitored constantly.
As the safety of a mine worker is important, monitoring mine employees in underground mines has become extremely challenging. Internet of things is a set of gadgets connected to the net. IOT implementation varies substantially on a massive scale. Internet of things Europe group has most essential IOT gadgets. Clever apps, clever power, enterprise, fitness, and clever cities as a whole encompass smart housing, smart transportation, and clever housing to call a few nets of things is a sport-changing invention in which all sensory records are stored within the cloud and accessed fast.

### Literature Survey
#### Hua FU Tao WANG Cui YANG et al.,[1]- Have detailed discussion about The intelligent fuzzy sensing system for coal mine safety combines neural networks and fuzzy theory to transform parameters into language descriptions for outputting the safety state of the mine. The membership function generation network is used to obtain appropriate membership functions based on 100 groups of data, which are then used as input for the fuzzy reasoning network. The monitoring results of ten groups of testing samples show that the system accurately determines the safety state of the mine based on multiple parameters. The system overcomes the difficulties of accurately measuring parameters in a complex environment and provides easily understandable output for professionals, making it highly practical.
Xuelong Li et al., [2]- Have examined that During the 12th Five-Year Plan period in Guizhou province, coal mine safety was generally good with decreasing accidents and fatalities. Preventive measures, including safety law enforcement and technology, helped decrease accidents and improve mine safety. The analysis of coal mine accidents during the “12th Five-Year Plan” period revealed several main causes of accidents. These include a lack of awareness of safe production among employees, unlawful and illegal production, incomplete safety management systems, inadequate gas control measures, poor water pollution prevention and control, inadequate leadership by state-owned coal mining enterprises, failure to learn from previous accidents, gaps in local safety supervision, and the need to improve roof management technology. These issues should be addressed to improve the safety of coal mines in the future.

Zhang Yi et al., [3]- Reviewed a detailed discussion about a wireless sensor network-based monitoring system to manage explosive, corrosion, and accident hazards in underground coal mines. The device can monitor characteristics such as gas concentration, temperature, and humidity and alarm when they exceed present limits. The proposed system has a consistent performance, precise measurement, and contributes to increased mine safety while lowering accidents. The ZigBee wireless sensor nodes, routers, coordinators, mine network switches, and monitoring computers comprise the system. The wireless sensor nodes employ CC2530 ZigBee microcontroller chips and sensor modules to pre-process environmental monitoring signals. Gas sensors, carbon monoxide sensors, and temperature and humidity sensors are also included in the sensor nodes.  The router/coordinator nodes employ the CC2591, which combines a high-gain power amplifier, a balanced converter, and an RF matching network to increase wireless coverage range. The software architecture of the system includes sensor node program design, coordinator program design, and monitoring computer program design. The system can be extended to include video data acquisition to enable real-time monitoring of mine site operations.

Madhu Nakirekanti et al., [4]- The article outlines the architecture of a coal mine safety monitoring system based on ZigBee wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Using multiple sensors, the system seeks to monitor environmental characteristics in the mine, such as temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide gas levels. The sensor node data is wirelessly delivered to the controller section, which then delivers the information to the ground monitoring centre through ZigBee connection. As the controlling core for the WSNs nodes, the system additionally incorporates an ARM CPU module. Furthermore, miners employ frequency-based ID cards for access, and emergency services can be accessible via GSM connectivity. The technology is intended for use in coal mines because it is low-power and cost-effective. The article includes an overview of the system architecture and the different components used in the system design.

N Sathish Kumar et al., [5]- Have examined that, A wireless sensor network (WSN) and an Arduino UNO controller are used in a coal mine safety measurement system. By monitoring the status of the underground mine, this system intends to improve production safety control and prevent coal mine accidents. The WSN is comprised of a variety of sensors, including gas, temperature, humidity, vibration, and MEMS sensors. The information gathered by these sensors is sent to the Arduino UNO, which displays it on an LCD panel. If any parameter exceeds a specified limit, the system notifies the miners.WSN is advantageous over wired networks in coal mines because it is less expensive and can be put anywhere without the need for sophisticated and time-consuming cable-laying operations. The setup you described includes

S.R.Deokarl et al., [6]- Have reviewed that Several researchers have proposed various coal mine monitoring system implementations. Bluetooth wireless transmission, CAN bus technology, the RS485 bus, wireless sensor networks (WSN), and safety helmets equipped with gas sensors are among the implementations. Each implementation has benefits and drawbacks, such as limited data transfer distance, difficulty ensuring network reliability, and poor real-time performance. Some implementations also encounter installation and maintenance issues in the hostile underground mine environment. However, these technologies provide vital safety measures for miners and improve the communication range within the mine, preventing accidents and enhancing coal miners' safety conditions.

Xiaodong Pei et al., [7]-Have detailed discussion about the three-dimensional ventilation network experimental model was utilised to govern fan frequency conversion and control gas emission. The gas concentration in the stope had a power function relationship with the fan's operating frequency, and five wind regulation rules were established to match supply and demand during the working day. The dynamic control concept was effectively implemented in a Yangquan coal mine, lowering the danger of gas mishaps.To monitor and control airflow in a coal mine, a comprehensive experimental platform was created. Five regulation rules were developed, and automatic control of ventilator frequency and air supply depending on gas emission conditions was achieved. The software successfully controlled gas concentration and mitigated gas disaster risk, confirming the software's viability and efficiency.

Jiaqui Wang et al., [8]- Have proposed a method To achieve intelligent and effective management of coal mine safety accidents, digital twin technology is being integrated into coal mine safety management. The twin model architecture is investigated in order to build a twin safety management model for a coal mine gas accident. The advantages of the twin model are highlighted, and essential technical criteria are provided to expedite field use of the gas accident twin model.                         
Hongtu Zhang et al., [9]-This paper studies the effect of close-range protective layer mining (PLM) as a technique to prevent gas outburst in Hezhuang Coal mine. Using a simulation model, the authors analysed the stress evolution and deformation of the overlying coal seam (II1) after lower PLM in working face at different mining depths. The study provides a theoretical basis for the engineering application of lower PLM This paper simulates the stress and deformation of an overlying coal seam during lower protective layer mining (PLM). Results show that PLM can effectively release pressure and prevent gas outburst. The stress distribution of the overlying coal seam can be divided into three parts in both strike and dip directions, with unobvious deformation in the original stress zone, compressive deformation in the stress concentration zone, and expansive deformation in the pressure relief zone.

Rajkumar Boddu et al., [10]-  Have discussed to replace wired networks and avoid costly cable laying and blind spots, a wireless sensor network-based coal mine safety monitoring system is proposed. In coal mines, zigbee technology is employed to increase production safety and decrease accidents. The purpose of the study is to open the door for future research by offering a solution for wireless communication and safety monitoring in mines.An underground mine's gas concentration, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and miners' locations are all tracked via a wireless sensor network-based system. It increases the flexibility and usefulness of monitoring and automatically sounds an alarm when environmental factors go beyond the limit. This technology efficiently replaces conventional mine security measures, improves worker safety, and lowers coal mine accidents.
